# MERNG Project - Project Management App

## Overview

The Project Management App is a web application designed to facilitate project
management tasks. Users can effectively manage their client base and organize
their projects within this network application. The primary objective is to
demonstrate the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technology stack, along
with the utilization of GraphQL for efficient data handling. The Bootstrap
framework will be employed for styling purposes.

## Features

The Project Management app will offer the following features:

1. Client Management: Allow users to create, view, update, and delete client
   information.
2. Project Organization: Provide functionality for users to create, manage, and
   track their projects.
3. Task Tracking: Enable users to create tasks within projects and monitor their
   progress.
4. GraphQL Integration: Utilize GraphQL for efficient and optimized data
   fetching and manipulation.
5. CRUD Operations: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for
   clients, projects, and tasks.
6. Styling with Bootstrap: Utilize the Bootstrap framework to create an
   aesthetically pleasing user interface.

## Technology Stack

The MERNG project will leverage the following technologies:

- MongoDB: A document-oriented database for storing and retrieving data.
- Express.js: A web application framework for building server-side applications.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
